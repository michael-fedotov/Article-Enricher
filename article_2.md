# Capturing Carbon: A Practical Guide to Carbon Capture and Storage Technologies

Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) has re‑emerged as a central pillar in net‑zero roadmaps published
by the IPCC, the International Energy Agency, and dozens of national governments. Put simply, CCS
is a three‑step process: **capture** the CO₂ at the point of emission, **compress and transport**
the gas, and **store** it away from the atmosphere for centuries—preferably in deep geological
formations.

## How CO₂ is captured

1. **Post‑combustion scrubbing** – Flue gas from power plants is washed with amine solvents that bond
   with CO₂.  
2. **Pre‑combustion separation** – Fossil fuel is converted into a synthesis gas; CO₂ is extracted
   before combustion.  
3. **Direct air capture (DAC)** – Large fans push ambient air through solid sorbents that trap CO₂
   even at 420 ppm concentrations.

Advances in membrane materials and low‑temperature sorbents have cut capture energy penalties by
15 % over the past five years, according to research in *Energy & Environmental Science*.

## Moving the molecule

Once captured, CO₂ is compressed into a super‑critical fluid and sent via pipeline or ship. The
United States alone operates more than 8,000 km of dedicated CO₂ pipelines, primarily serving the
enhanced oil‑recovery sector, but new lines designed exclusively for permanent storage are under
permitting review on five continents.

## Storage options and risks

* **Saline aquifers** – Porous rock formations located 800–3,000 m below ground.  
* **Depleted oil & gas fields** – Existing wells lower exploration risk but require retrofit sealing.  
* **Basalt formations** – React with CO₂ to form stable carbonate minerals in less than two years.

Leakage remains the chief public concern; however, monitoring technologies such as satellite
interferometry and fibre‑optic sensing can detect pressure changes as small as 0.01 bar.

## Economics and policy

BloombergNEF estimates the levelised cost of CO₂ capture at \$54–123 t⁻¹ today, but recent U.S.
Inflation Reduction Act tax credits (45Q) pay up to \$85 t⁻¹ for storage in saline formations.
Similar incentives exist in Canada, the U.K., and Japan.

## Outlook

Meeting the IEA’s Sustainable Development Scenario requires scaling CCS capacity from today’s
52 Mt yr⁻¹ to 1.7 Gt yr⁻¹ by 2040. While critics argue CCS prolongs the life of fossil fuels,
the consensus among climate modellers is clear: without large‑scale carbon capture, the cost of
achieving net‑zero could rise by 70 %.

CCS is not a silver bullet, but in sectors where process emissions are unavoidable—cement, steel,
fertiliser—it may be the only viable route to deep decarbonisation.
